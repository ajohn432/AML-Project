# FortranMachineLearning
The purpose of this project is to create a database with fortran to study the language as a curiosity, and to fulfill the requirements for my Applied Machine Learning masters course. I will be using machine learning models on the data and attempt to use python create ML models, and attempt to create Fortran endpoints.
